                <h2>Tenney Park</h2>
                <p>With its friendly atmosphere and impressive display of storybook scenery Tenney Park serves as a
                    place to socialize, a peaceful recluse, and a place to just be. It's an excellent place to watch
                    boats launch, seagulls flock, let the children play at the park, or just catch up on some reading.
